# Midterm

Describe the assignment:
Create a webspage that displays data retrieved from calling 2 different APIs.

Discuss what you chose to do and why:
Explain your process:
I wanted to do my original idea of "Song Vomit" where a user types in any word and a song with lyrics containing that word will play. However, I could not figure out the Spotify API. I went with the EventFul and Weather APIs. When a user types in a city, a list of all the events occuring in that city (along with the venue, date and time, and URL)today will pop up, along with the local weather. I wanted to include the nature of the venues- whether it is a weather-sensitive venue or not, but I wasn't able to know that from the given API data.

Document any resources/research/inspiration:
I really appreciate the eventful API- you can see all events in your city- book events, music, gym, etc.

Highlight both successes and failures:
Successes: I was able to use 2 APIs, a for-loop, and an if-else statement!
Failures: The Spotify API, The format of the date & time on the EventFul API, The hyperlink on the URL (in the json data of the eventful API)
